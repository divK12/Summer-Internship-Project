# Summer Internship Project

**Duration:** May 2024 - July 2024

**Organization:** Coriolis Technologies

## Project Overview

During the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to work with Coriolis Technologies on a project focused on **automating the creation and grading of subjective questions and answers from PDF documents**.

## Project Details

- **Objective:** Develop a system to generate diverse types of subjective questions from PDFs and automate the grading of answers.
- **QA Generation:**
    - Created refined prompts for generating a diverse range of questions, enabling a deeper and non-monotonic understanding of the documents.
    - Implemented RAG to generate contextually relvant answers
- **Evaluation Tool:** 
  - Developed a robust evaluation mechanism capable of assessing answers with a high level of precision.
  - The evaluation system has been tested against human evaluations and LangSmith to ensure accuracy and reliability.

This project aimed to enhance the efficiency of creating and grading subjective questions/answers, providing a more comprehensive assessment of document content.
