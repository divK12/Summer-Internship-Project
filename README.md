# Summer-Internship-Project
This summer of 2024 (May 2024-July-2024), I had received the opportunity to work with the Coriolis Technologies on 
##Automating creation & grading of subjective Question & Answers from the PDF documents.
The project uses LangChain, OpenAI with refined prompt strategies to develop diverse types of questions for a deeper and non-monogamous understanding of the documents.
We have also developed a robust evaluation tool that has the capability to assess answers at the minutest levels. We have tested the evaluation system against human based evaluation and LangSmith.
